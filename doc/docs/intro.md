# Useless yet NEETBox

NEETBox contains useless code snippets for Computer Vision. The repository itself is still under construction and for now it has not much code inside. Nevertheless, we are always adding new code snippets. So here is the thing: I'm new to complex Computer Vision projects and I found myself writing duplicate codes somehow, in different projects. So I'm going to have code snippets for myself and for other beginners who would like to have one.

## Installation

```bash
pip install neetbox
```
if error occured, try:
```bash
pip install --index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ neetbox --no-deps
```
:::note
Why `--no-deps`? Because we had a hard time resolving the dependency :(  
Please manually install dependencies after you got errors

## If you want (Click to go):

- [x] [Simple Logging Utility](./logging/)
- [x] [Basic PyTorch Code Snippets](./torch-snippets/)

:::caution
Another problem here is that since the repository is still under construction, most of the codes do not have related docs. Sorry that some of the codes are massed up without regular comments on them. The docs will appear soon.
