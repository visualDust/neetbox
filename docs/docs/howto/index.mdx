## Introduction

> <span style={{fontSize:"30px", color:"red"}}><strong><i>I hate tensorboard, let’s make a toolbox to replace it</i></strong></span>
> —— Someone who created a new folder named NEETBOX

Therefore, NEETBOX is a ~~tensorboard replacement~~ python package which provides **dashboard for monitoring and managing deep learning projects**.

> But wait, Tensorboard is actually a great software, DO NOT necessarily hate it, I'm just joking.

Therefore, The name NEETBOX is derived from the word "NEET"(see [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEET)). It was named this way because NEETBOX is a naive project, and the people who developed NEETBOX are idiots.
